Repository for large projects I have worked on

##Project2
I was tasked with developing and implementing a numerical method to solve a partial differential
equation for a simply supported beam under a uniformly distributed load. Within the .pdf file you will find information on how to compile the code and how it functions. This projects combined plotting, objectoriented programming, verification of implementation, and many numerical methods discussed in the course COE311K.
