# Projects
Repository for large projects I have worked on

## Project2
I was tasked with developing and implementing a numerical method to solve a partial differential
equation for a simply supported beam under a uniformly distributed load. Within the .pdf file you will find information on how to compile the code and how it functions. This projects combined plotting, objectoriented programming, verification of implementation, and many numerical methods discussed in the course COE311K. 

## Redistricting
In this project we explored the idea of 'gerrymandering', the strategic drawing of districts to give a minority population the majority of district. Through this project, I and two other students seeked to answer the question, how much of an upper hand can the minority get? This project involved a recursive function capable of finding the best possible way to redistrict a population out of all possible redistricting options. Below I will show a small example of how the code is suppose to function, but more information about the projects and the issue of redistricting can be found within the pdf file. 

```bash
Original population [1,1,1,-1,-1]
Inputed districts = 3
Output [[1,1,1][-1][-1]]

As you can see the minority (-1) has two out of the three districts despite being .4 of the population.
When scaled up using the population generator we can see redistricting strategies, such as packing/grouping.
